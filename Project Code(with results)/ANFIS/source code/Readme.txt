Instructions to run the code:

1. Replace the path of the input files as per your system path(i.e, the path where these files have been saved).
   For Example, the path of file on my system for loading input is "C:\Users\ravip\Desktop\Project Code\ANFIS\input\standardized_training.xlsx"

2. Run ANFIS_code.m to get NO2 & O3 prediction using ANFIS model. 

3. Give a 13 input vector to the model for t-time to get predicted value for t+1.
