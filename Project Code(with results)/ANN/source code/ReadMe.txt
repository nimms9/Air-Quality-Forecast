Instructions to run the code:

1. Replace the path of the input files as per your system path(i.e, the path where these files have been saved).
   For Example, the path of file on my system for loading input is 'C:\Users\ravip\Desktop\Project Code\ANN\input\Standard_Input(Training).csv'

2. Run ANN_NO2.m to get NO2 prediction by ANN model.

3. Run ANN_O3.m to get O3 prediction ANN model. 

3. Give a 13 input vector to the model for t-time to get predicted value for t+1.
