This "Project Code" Folder consists the following -

1. Each of the model folders(ANN,ANFIS,PCA_ANN,PCA_ANFIS) consists of -
   a. Input       - This folder consists of the input datasets for each model, Output and Source Code for each model.
   b. Source Code - This folder consists of the code regarding prediction of the NO2 and O3 concentrations for the next 8 hours.
		    If the concentrations are beyond the permissible levels alerts will be generated in the window(which is higlighted in each code snippet).
   c. Output      - This folder consists of the result datasets and screenshots of various outputs for various models.

2. The "Preprocessing and Standardization of Data" consists of the following python codes for -
   a. Creating Datasets
   b. Preprocessing Datasets
   c. Standardized Datasets(Converting the raw data into normalized/standardized form)

Note: Permissible level of NO2 is 200 µg/m3 
      Permissible level of O3 is 100 µg/m3
